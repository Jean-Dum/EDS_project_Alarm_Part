## Motion detection alarm

### Desired features

The main idea is to build a system which can detect the movement of a person using a PIR sensor. This movement will trigger an alarm and communicate using LoRa to another MCU managed by our associated team. The only way of desactivate the alarm is to introduce the correct code in the second team's terminal.

The system will also include a buzzer and a test button.

### Obtained features

Our PCB is now able to detect the movements up to 4 meters away. It makes the buzzer ring and to stop it you just have to press the button on the PCB.

At the programm beginning there is 10 seconds of waiting in order to wait for the user to go away (otherwise it will disrupt the sensor calibration) during which the info LED is blinking. Then there is 10 seconds of sensor calibration, in which it makes a 40 samples average to make a reference value and makes the LED blinking faster.

Then the programm runs and the buzzer will ring only if the sensor value exceeds the reference value.

If the alarm is stopped by pressing the button, to reactivate it just press again the buttton, the software will again wait 10 seconds to let the user go away to avoid the buzzer to ring immediatly and then run motion detection again. During this time the info LED is blinking again.

Our system send a '1' by serial connection when the sensor is triggered. The alarm can be turned off by serial connection if it receive a '1' but to do so you have to uncomment lines 143 to 152 and build the code again.

## Run project

### Hardawre

- Connect the St-Link programmer from the nucleo board to the PCB. To do so just connect the SWD pins to the programming pins of our PCB, in the same order.
- Then verify that the nucleo St-Link programmer wont programm the nucleo board but our PCB. To do so remove the St-Link programmer and nucleo board connectors and remove the connector that power the nucleo board.
- Then connect both the St-Link programmer and PCB USB to your computer.

### Software
Open a terminal
#### Packages installation
- First of all install openocd:
> sudo apt-get install openocd
- install cargo:
> sudo apt-get install cargo
- install arm-none-eabi-gdb:
> sudo apt-get install arm-none-eabi-gdb
- Update rust tools:
> rustup update
> rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf

#### Build software
> cargo build --release

#### Run software
- Clone this repo on your computer:
> git clone https://github.com/Jean-Dum/EDS_project_Alarm_Part.git
- Then go in the software directory:
> cd EDS_project_Alarm_Part/Software/
- Execute openocd software:
> openocd -f openocd.cfg
- Open a new terminal (in the same directory) and run the code:
> cargo build --release
- Now you are in the GDB interface, just type "c" and press two times enter key. You can look the code output in the openocd terminal.

## Possible Extras

If everything goes on time and we do not have any big difficulties in the project, we plan to add also some kind of smoke detector so the alarm system is more complete. 

We also thought of adding a fingerprint sensor for desactivating the alarm in the detector terminal.

## Limitations

The fact of working two groups together makes the communication between terminals harder but we dont expect any other big problem in our terminal.

The main limitation was that there few informations about Rust (and especially about the stm32L0) on internet, doing our researchs to resolve our problems was really difficult.

## Design and Electronic

We design our circuit using Kicad and testing some parts of the circuit in LTspice.  

![Schematic](https://github.com/Jean-Dum/EDS_project_Alarm_Part/blob/master/EDS_ALARM/Image.png)   


### Some facts about the circuit
	
- Three different leds for: testing the MCU, the power and one for the test button 
	
- We add a different voltage regulator (LT1117) that allows us to have 3.3v always without the need of resistors for adjustment of the output, so we we reduce the space used.

- For the Smoke detector we used a potentiometer we can use for changing the output, this is because the detector can work on different environments (humidity, temperature...) and we need to adjust the potentiometer to have an ideal output.

### Layout

For the layout we tried to make the PCB as small as possible so it can fit in a small case and this way the detection system will be more inconspicuous.

![Top Layout](https://github.com/Jean-Dum/EDS_project_Alarm_Part/blob/master/EDS_ALARM/front_layout.png)   
![Bottom Layout](https://github.com/Jean-Dum/EDS_project_Alarm_Part/blob/master/EDS_ALARM/bottom_layout.png)   

All the components are in the same layer (top) but the PIR, this way we have more space and a better 'view' for the motion sensor. The connectors are all placed on the sides of the board so it is easier to use them. We tried to put the buzzer as far as possible from the MCU just incase the vibrations of the buzzer can make any damage on the small soldering pads of the MCU in a large period of time, the decoupling capacitors and sensors are placed as close as possible from the MCU.

### Testing

We did some different tests on the board before and after ordering it
- We used LTspice to make sure everything was okey
- Test for short-circuits and bad connections
- Test after soldering the MCU
- For short-circuits between pads (here we detected a problem)
- For voltage reverse to make sure all the pads were connected
- We tested the MCU by connecting it at a low current
- Test the final performance 

## Issues / Problems 

- Circuit
	- The LT1117 pins of the footprint where wrong (they were saved as if it was LM1117) so we had to make a small fix

- Layout and soldering
	- We had to apply the re-flow process twice because of a lack of flux in the first re-flow but finally applying more flux and doing the process again we managed to solder it perfect.

- Programming
	- It took us some time to manage to connect the PCB and didn't succeed to use vscode to run our code.
	- We made a mistake on the pins connection: The PA4 pin (used for the buzzer) don't generate PWM, we had to add a wire between the PA4 and PA3 pins because PA3 can generate PWM and is used for the smoke sensor, which is not used.
	- We didn't succeed to use the Lora module, by lack of time and because this one is way to complicated to use.
	- All the programming part was really complicated to realise, in fact there is not a lot of things about rust and espetially with the stm32L0 on internet, resolving our issues was a real struggle.
