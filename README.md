# EDS_project_Alarm_Project

ESD project: Movement alarm detector The main idea is to build a system which can detect the movement of a person using a PIR sensor. This movement will trigger an alarm and communicate using LoRa to another MCU managed by our associated team. The only way of desactivate the alarm is to introduce the correct code in the second teams terminal.


## Principal Equipment

	- PIR Sensor 	           --> EKMC1601111 - Motion sensor 5m 94Â°, Panasonic
	
	- Electromechanical Buzzer --> RND 430-00016 - 80dB, 2.4kHz, 3V, SMD
